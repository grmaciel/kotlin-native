# Word of the Day Spike with Kotlin native for Android, iOS and Web Application

## Description

Pretty simple Spike with an ios / android / web project making use of kotlin native for code sharing. 

Architecture was pretty basic without worrying much about DI and tests. It's' just a basic `UseCase -> Repository` with a `ViewModel` encharged of loading and delivering the `Model`.

## Next steps

* Make the word of the day a call to a backend with kotlin native and make some actual requests.
* Improve architecture
* Add tests integration
